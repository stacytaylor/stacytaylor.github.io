      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
    <p>I'm a UX Designer with a knack for getting inside a user's head, analyzing problems from all angles, and coming up with creative, out-of-the-box solutions to complex problems. </p>

    <p>With a Master's Degree in Information Science, I excel at organizing information and improving discoverability. After more than nine years applying user-centered design principles in the library industry, I'm looking to branch out and explore different fields.</p>

    <p>A natural-born problem solver, I was the kid who took things apart to figure out how they worked and spent my weekend participating in regional problem solving competitions. I'm constantly analyzing the systems around me to figure out how they might be improved.</p>

    <p>I'm a confident presenter, able to seamlessly flip my communication style depending on my target audience. I can advocate for the business value of UX with stakeholders, talk design specifications with developers, and put end-users at ease while conducting research.</p>

    <p>My professional experience includes: user research, usability testing, information architecture, interaction design, content strategy, UI design, and branding.</p>

    <p>When I'm not geeking out over design I can generally be found hanging out with my adorably neurotic canine companion, reading four books at a time, and exploring the mountains of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
